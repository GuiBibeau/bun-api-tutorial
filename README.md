# Bun API tutorial repo

This repo is a companion to my youtube video on how to deploy and build a bun.js API for early 2024.

## stack:

make sure you install bun

- [Bun](https://bun.sh/)
- [Fly.io](https://fly.io/)

- [Elysia](https://elysiajs.com/)
- [Bun Test](https://bun.sh/docs/cli/test)

To install dependencies:

```bash
bun install
```

To run:

```bash
bun run dev
```

To test:

```
bun test
```

This project was created using `bun init` in bun v1.0.19. [Bun](https://bun.sh) is a fast all-in-one JavaScript runtime.
